# Microcontrollers Notes

This is where I host my lecture note outline for ENGIN-2223 at COD. The lecture content comes from the class textbook and lab manual (linked below under resources).

## Course Description

> This is an introduction to the structure of microprocessors. The topics include architecture, instruction set, assembly language programming, assembler directives, input/output operations, C language programming for an embedded device, timers, analog-to-digital conversion, interrupts, and timing analysis.
